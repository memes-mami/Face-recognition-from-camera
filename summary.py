This is an attendance log from a face recognition app.

Each person is listed with time intervals they were detected in a video. Some people may appear with slight name variations (like "Alex" and "Alex_1"). There may also be many tiny intervals due to real-time processing.

Please:

1. Give a **friendly and short human-style summary**.
2. Combine similar names (like "Ravi" and "Ravi_1") into one person.
3. Ignore short/duplicate detections ‚Äî just group meaningfully.
4. Say how many people appeared, and who stayed the longest.
5. Include a **clever example** of someone with the most screen time (mention their total time).
6. Mention if any unknown or very brief faces showed up too.

Explain it like you‚Äôre telling a curious friend who just uploaded this file:

{log_content}
